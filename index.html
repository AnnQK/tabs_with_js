            <p class="tabs__text">
              Strength training, also known as resistance training, causes
              contractions of the muscles via external resistance. The
              resistance can come from using barbells, dumbbells, resistance
              bands, strength machines or a person's own body weight.

            <p class="tabs__text">
              Endurance exercise, also known as aerobic exercise, helps develop
              stamina. It can also improve the functioning of the heart and
              lungs. Another benefit of endurance exercise is an increase in the
              body's metabolic rate, which helps a person burn calories long
              after their workout is complete and assist in a person's
              body-reshaping efforts.

            <div class="tabs__header">Static Stretching</div>

            <p class="tabs__text">
              As we age, our muscles become inflexible and taut. To combat
              muscle inflexibility, static stretching is recommended. Benefits
              of static stretching include enhanced range of motion, stronger
              joints, better physical performance while playing sports and a
              decrease in pain throughout the body.

              Protein is essential to good health. The very origin of the word —
              from the Greek protos, meaning "first" — reflects proteins
              top-shelf status in human nutrition. You need it to put meat on
              your bones and to make hair, blood, connective tissue, antibodies,
              enzymes, and more. Its common for athletes and bodybuilders to
              wolf down extra protein to bulk up.

            <p class="slide__text">
              A small amount of fat is an essential part of a healthy, balanced
              diet. Fat is a source of essential fatty acids, which the body
              cannot make itself. Fat helps the body absorb vitamin A, vitamin D
              and vitamin E. These vitamins are fat-soluble, which means they
              can only be absorbed with the help of fats.

            <p class="slide__text">
              Foods high in carbohydrates are an important part of a healthy
              diet. Carbohydrates provide the body with glucose, which is
              converted to energy used to support bodily functions and physical
              activity. But carbohydrate quality is important; some types of
              carbohydrate-rich foods are better than others.
